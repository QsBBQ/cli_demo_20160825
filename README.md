# Purpose

Share some things I learned moving from Python to Go. Simple command line
utilities: job splitter, x509 cert manager, journald to elasticsearch indexer.
Things I used to write in Python. tl;dr the sweet spot between C and Python.

# Focus

- io / stdin / out
- strings / []byte
- structs: embedded anonymous fields / composition / json
- testing / examples / benchmarks
